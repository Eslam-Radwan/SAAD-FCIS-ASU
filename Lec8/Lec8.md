## 05. Product Feature Prioritization Techniques

### Feature Prioritization Techniques

1. **Kano Model**: Evaluates customer delight versus product function.
2. **Value vs. Complexity Quadrant**: Prioritizes initiatives based on business value and implementation complexity.
3. **Weighted Scoring**: Ranks features based on multiple criteria like revenue increase, customer value, and strategic value.
4. **RICE Scoring Model**: Prioritizes features based on Reach, Impact, Confidence, and Effort.
5. **Eisenhower Matrix**: Categorizes tasks by urgency and importance.
6. **Story Mapping**: Arranges user stories to create a holistic view of the user experience.
7. **MoSCoW Model**: Prioritizes features into Must-have, Should-have, Could-have, and Won't-have categories.

---

### Kano Model

- **Customer Delight vs. Product Function**: Evaluates how much a feature delights customers versus the investment required to improve it.
- **Basic Needs**: Features that customers expect (e.g., a car stopping when brakes are applied).
- **Performance Needs**: Features that improve customer satisfaction (e.g., fuel efficiency).
- **Delighters**: Features that surprise and delight customers (e.g., voice-activated parking).

---

### Value vs. Complexity Quadrant

- **High Value, Low Complexity**: Low-hanging fruit, prioritize these first.
- **High Value, High Complexity**: Important but resource-intensive, plan carefully.
- **Low Value, Low Complexity**: Low priority, consider delegating or automating.
- **Low Value, High Complexity**: Avoid, as they offer little return for high effort.

---

### Weighted Scoring

- **Example Table**:

| **Title**                     | **Benefit** | **Cost** | **Score** | **Rank** |
|-------------------------------|-------------|----------|-----------|----------|
| New Admin Console             | 20          | 20       | 120       | 1        |
| Mobile Product Line           | 1           | 4        | 72        | 4        |
| Android Infrastructure Projects | 3           | 4        | 84        | 2        |
| Customer Experience Initiatives | 3           | 5        | 96        | 1        |
| Cloud support for PowerLink   | 5           | 3        | 84        | 2        |
| iOS Reporting                 | 3           | 3        | 68        | 5        |

---

### RICE Scoring Model

- **Reach**: How many people will this feature affect?
- **Impact**: How much will this feature impact individual users?
- **Confidence**: How confident are you in your estimates?
- **Effort**: How much work is required to implement the feature?

---

### Eisenhower Matrix

- **Urgent & Important**: Do these tasks immediately.
- **Not Urgent & Important**: Schedule these tasks.
- **Urgent & Not Important**: Delegate these tasks.
- **Not Urgent & Not Important**: Eliminate these tasks.

---

### Story Mapping

- **User Journey**: Arrange user stories in chronological order based on the customer journey.
- **Releases**: Group stories into releases to plan development phases.

---

### MoSCoW Model

- **Must-have**: Non-negotiable needs for the product.
- **Should-have**: Important but not vital features.
- **Could-have**: Nice-to-have features with small impact.
- **Won't-have**: Features not prioritized for this release.
