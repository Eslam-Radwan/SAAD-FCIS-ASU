## Analysis Phase

- **Who will use the system.**  
- **What the system will do.**  
- **Where and when it will be used.**  

### Two Sub-phases:

1. **Requirements Determination:**  
   - Careful study of the organization's current procedures and the information systems used to perform organizational tasks.  

2. **Requirements Structuring:**  
   - Relationships between requirements and eliminating redundancy.  

---

## What is a Requirement?

- A **Requirement** is a usable representation of a **need**.  
- Requirements focus on **understanding what kind of value could be delivered if a requirement is fulfilled.**  
- A requirement defines:  
	- A **Feature** that a future solution has to enable (e.g., Cloud Access).  
	- A **Function** that a future solution has to execute (e.g., Calculate Savings).  
	- A **Fact** that a future solution has to enforce (e.g., regulations).  
	- A **Quality** that a future solution has to exhibit (e.g., Access file in 1 second).

## Requirement Classification Schema

1. **Business requirements**  
2. **Stakeholder requirements**  
3. **Solution requirements**  
4. **Transition requirements**  

---

### Requirement Classification Schema

1. **Business Requirements:**  
   - Statements of goals, objectives, and outcomes that describe why a change has been initiated. 
   - They can apply to the whole of an enterprise, a business area, or a specific initiative.  
---

2. **Stakeholder Requirements:**  
   - Describe the needs and wants of stakeholders that must be met to achieve the business requirements.  
   - They may serve as a bridge between business and solution requirements.  
---

3. **Solution Requirements:**  
   - Describe the capabilities (functions) and qualities of a solution that meets the stakeholder requirements.  
   - They provide the appropriate level of detail to allow for the development and implementation of the solution.  

   ### **Solution requirements can be divided into two sub-categories:**  
   
   - **Functional Requirements:**  
     - What the system should DO?  
     - Describe the capabilities/features that a solution must have in terms of the behavior and information that the solution will manage.  
   - **Non-Functional Requirements:**  
	 - How the system should BE?  
	 - Describe conditions/performance constraints under which a solution must remain effective or qualities that a solution must have.  
---
4. **Transition Requirements:**  
   - Describe the capabilities that the solution must have and the conditions the solution must meet to facilitate transition from the current state to the future state, but which are not needed once the change is complete.  
   - They address topics such as data conversion, training, and business continuity.  

---

## Business Requirements

- Define the high-level goals and objectives.  
- Address the question "Why the project is needed."  
- Executive levels usually define the business requirements.  
- Their purpose is to prioritize and resource projects.  

**Recommended Structure:**  
- to (Business Outcome) (The Organization or a Group) Need/Want/Will/Should (Action)  

---

### Business Requirements Examples

- **Example 1:**  
  - To maintain our leadership role within the industry, BA-EXPERTS needs to increase gross, on-line sales by 15% this fiscal year.  
  - **Action:** Increase online sales.  

- **Example 2:**  
  - To increase our customer retention, the claims department needs to reduce claims processing time from 10 days to 1 day by the end of the third quarter.  
  - **Action:** Reduce claims processing time.  

---

## Stakeholder Requirements

- Express the needs and wants of one or more stakeholders and how they will interact with the solution.  
- Bridge business requirements and solution requirements.  
- Focus on **what is needed**, not **how to achieve it**.  

**Structure:**  
- As a (Stakeholder / Group)  I/we (can / cannot)  (Do, Know, or Have something)  , to
	(Achieve my goal or objective)  

---

### Stakeholder Requirements Examples

- **Example 1:**  
  - As a customer, I can browse the current product catalog to select items that I want to buy.  

- **Example 2:**  
  - As a website visitor, I can view the cost of coverage for each insurance provider.  

---

## Solution Requirements

- Describe specific characteristics of the solution that meet business and stakeholder requirements.  
- Functional requirements should be easy for the developer to use.  
- Expressed as:  
	- List of functions  
	- Solution use cases  
	- List of data elements  
	- Prototypes  
	- Process diagrams  
	- Activity diagrams  

**Examples:**  
- Calculate total charges including delivery costs and taxes.  
- Do not ship goods to customers with overdue accounts.  

---

### Key Types of Non-Functional Requirements

- Performance  
- Scalability  
- Portability  
- Usability  
- Compatibility  
- Localization  
- Reliability  
- Security  
- Maintainability  
- Availability  

---

## Transition Requirements

- Describe capabilities needed to integrate the proposed solution into the existing environment.  
- Describes capabilities the solution must have to facilitate getting from the current state (as-is) to the future state (to-be).  
- Not needed once the solution is in production.  
- Defined by complete sentences.  
- Impossible to finalize the transition requirements before the design of the selected solution is complete.  

---

### Transition Requirements Examples

- Sales personnel must attend a 2-day new customer acquisition program prior to using the new sales support system.  
- All existing customer data will be maintained in both the old and new database format until the end of the first quarter.  

---

## Examples

- **Stakeholder Requirement:**  
  - As a user, the app must run on all versions of the iPhone.  

- **Solution Requirement:**  
  - **Functional Requirement:** The app must have a drop-down menu in black text on a light blue background that allows the user to select the product he wants to purchase.  
  - **Non-Functional Requirement:** The app must offer 100% reliability with high traffic.  

---

## Requirements vs. Design

| **Requirement** | **Design** |
|-----------------|------------|
| View six months of sales data across multiple organizational units in a single view. | A sketch of a dashboard. |
| Reduce the amount of time required to pick and pack a customer order. | Process model. |

## Requirement Determination Tasks

1. **Prepare for Elicitation**  
2. **Conduct Elicitation**  
3. **Confirm Elicitation Results**  
4. **Communicate Information**  
5. **Manage Stakeholder Collaboration**  

---

### 1. Prepare for Elicitation

- Define the desired outcomes of the activity.  
- Consider the stakeholders involved and the goals of the initiative.  
- Determine which work products will be produced using the elicitation results.  
- Decide which techniques are best suited to produce those results.  
- Establish the elicitation logistics.  
- Identify any supporting materials needed.  
- Understand circumstances to foster collaboration during an elicitation activity.  

---

### 2. Conduct Elicitation

- The purpose of conducting elicitation is to draw out, explore, and identify information relevant to the change.  

**Elicitation Techniques:**  
1. **Traditional Methods:**  
   - Interviewing and Listening  
   - Interviewing Groups  
   - Survey and Questionnaire  
   - Ethnography (Directly Observing Users)  
   - Analyzing Procedures and Other Documents  

2. **Modern Methods:**  
   - Joint Application Design  
   - Prototyping  

---

### 3. Confirm Elicitation Results

- Elicited information is confirmed to identify any problems and resolve them before resources are committed to using the information.  
- This review may discover errors, omissions, conflicts, and ambiguity.  
- Collaboration with stakeholders might be necessary to ensure their inputs are correctly captured and that they agree with the results of non-facilitated elicitation.  
- If information is not correct, the analyst determines what is correct, which can require more elicitation.  

---

### 4. Communicate Information

- The purpose of communicating analysis information is to ensure stakeholders have a shared understanding of analysis information.  
- Analysts must communicate appropriate information to stakeholders at the right time and in formats (language, tone, style) that meet their needs.  
- Communication of analysis information is bi-directional and iterative.  

---

### 5. Manage Stakeholder Collaboration

- The purpose of managing stakeholder collaboration is to encourage stakeholders to work towards a common goal.  
- Stakeholders hold various degrees of influence and authority over the approval of work products and are also an important source of needs, constraints, and assumptions.  
- As the analysis work progresses, the analyst identifies stakeholders, confirms their roles, and communicates with them to ensure that the right stakeholders participate at the right times and in the appropriate roles.  
- Managing stakeholder collaboration is an ongoing activity.  

---

### Stakeholder Matrix

- Maps the level of stakeholder influence against the level of impact on the stakeholder.  

| **Influence of Stakeholder** | **Impact on Stakeholder** |
|------------------------------|---------------------------|
| High: Ensure stakeholder remains satisfied. | Work closely with stakeholder to ensure that they are in agreement with and support the change. |
| Monitor to ensure stakeholders' interest or influence does not change. | Keep informed; stakeholder is likely to be very concerned and may feel anxious about lack of control. |

---

### Personas

- A persona is defined as a fictional character that exemplifies the way a typical user interacts with a product.  
- A persona is a fictitious character used as a specific representative of a user class.  

**Examples:**  
- Yoshi is a 20-year-old pole vaulter from Tokyo who speaks some English.  
- Bob is an IBM sysadmin in New York.  
- Fritz is the 50-year-old father of a German family.  

---

## Hospital Management System Example

1. **Doctor Requirements:**  
   - Can visit patients, examine them, add diagnoses, record symptoms, prescribe drugs, schedule medical procedures, report the patient condition, and finally discharge the patient.  

2. **System Requirements:**  
   - Keeps information regarding symptoms, diagnosis details, and prescription drug details.  

3. **Patient Requirements:**  
   - Can register themselves, unregister, confirm medical procedures, and fill out request forms for discharge.  

4. **Patient History:**  
   - Can be accessed by the doctor to make better judgments.  

5. **Patient Status:**  
   - Includes: hospitalized, intensive care, away, and discharged.  

---

## Exercise

- Re-write requirement 3 as a stakeholder requirement.  
- Re-write requirement 4 as a non-functional requirement.  
- Suggest a transition requirement for the hospital management system.  
- Which of these requirements is a business requirement?  
- Suggest two personas after reading requirement 3.  

---

## Mind Mapping

- Mind mapping is used to articulate and capture thoughts, ideas, and information.  
- Mind maps use images, words, color, and connected relationships to apply structure and logic to thoughts, ideas, and information.  
- A mind map has a central main idea supported by secondary ideas (or topics), followed by as many layers of ideas (or sub-topics) as necessary to fully capture and articulate the concept.  
- Connections are made between ideas by branches that typically have a single keyword associated with them that explains the connection.  

---

### Mind Map - Example

- **Stakeholders**  
- **Requirements**  
- **Project Partners**  
- **Who?**  
- **What?**  
- **Business Rules**  
- **Business Case**  
- **Why?**  
- **Project X**  
- **Where?**  
- **Locations**  
- **Solutions**  
- **Project Timelines**  
- **Methods**  
- **How?**  
- **When?**  

---

### Mind Map - Example 2

- **50 Active Users**  
- **System Users**  
- **200 Downstream/Data Users**  
- **Project Sponsors**  
- **Who?**  
- **Project Partners**  
- **Implementation Partners**  
- **Operations Support Team**
