## 02 Agile? What's/Why

---

### What's/Why Agile?

- **Linear vs Iterative Development**:
  - **Linear Execution**: Deviation from the initial plan.
  - **Iterative Development**: Changes are expected, and the goal evolves.

## 03 Agile Manifesto/Principles of Agile

---

### Manifesto For Agile

**Agile Manifesto**:  
We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work, we have come to value:

- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools.
- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation.
- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation.
- **Responding to change** over following a plan.

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

## 03 What's/Why Scrum?

---

### What's/Why Scrum?

- **AGILE METHODS AND PRACTICES**:  
  Scrum and related variants continue to be the most common Agile methodologies used by respondents' organizations.

### What’s/Why Scrum?

- Scrum is a framework that helps teams work together.
- Scrum describes a set of meetings, tools, and roles that work in concert to help teams structure and manage their work.
- Scrum is a subset of Agile. It is a lightweight process framework for agile development, and the most widely-used one.
- Increase the quality of the deliverables.
- Overcome better with change (and expect the changes).
- Provide better estimates while spending less time creating them.
- Be more in control of the project schedule and state.

---

### What's/Why Scrum?

- **CUSTOMER**: More responsive to requests.
- **DEVELOPMENT TEAMS**: Enjoy development work, training in daily meetings.
- **SCRUMMASTER**: Focused on high-value features.
- **PRODUCT OWNER**: Development work aligns with customer needs.
- **PMOS AND C-LEVEL EXECUTIVES**: High visibility of daily project development.

## Scrum Pillars

- **Transparency**: Current status is visible to the team and stakeholders.
- **Inspection**: Brings the teams and stakeholders closer to the optimal solution.
- **Adaptation**: Business environment and priorities can be unpredictable, and change must be prepared to make trade-offs to optimize business value.

### Scrum Overview - Backlog

- **The Sprint Backlog**:
  - Is the Sprint plan the team constructs.

![](figures/f-11.png)

---

### Scrum Overview - Estimations

- **Story Points**:
  - Estimate Stories with relative Story points.
  - A Story point represents:
    - How big is the User Story effort.
    - How much is unknown.
  - The bigger the effort, the higher the estimation in Story Points.
  - The more unknowns, the higher the estimation in Story Points.
  - The most popular Story Point scale is the Rounded, or Modified, Fibonacci scale: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40, 100.
![](figures/f-13.png)

---

### Scrum Overview - Estimations

- **Story Points**:
  - A 1-point User Story is a User Story that can be coded and tested in 1 day.
  - Any User Story that is about double the effort is a 2-point User Story.
  - Any User Story that is about triple the effort of the 1-point User Story is a 3-point User Story.
