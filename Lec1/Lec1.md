## Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC)  
The SDLC is a traditional methodology for developing, maintaining, and replacing information systems. It consists of an orderly set of activities planned for each development project. Each phase has specific outcomes and deliverables that feed important information to other phases.  

### Phases in SDLC:  
1. **Planning**  
2. **Analysis**  
3. **Design**  
4. **Implementation**  
5. **Testing**  
6. **Maintenance**  

---

### SDLC Planning Phase  
- **Purpose**: Determine why an information system should be built.  
- **Key Activities**:  
  - Identify, analyze, prioritize, and arrange IS needs.  
  - Develop a plan for how the project team will build the system.  

#### 1. Project Initiation  
  - Identify business needs and how the system will create business value.  
  - Conduct **Feasibility Analysis**:  
    - **Technical Feasibility**: Can we build it?  
    - **Economic Feasibility**: Will it provide business value?  
    - **Organizational Feasibility**: If we build it, will it be used?  

#### 2. Project Management  
  - Once approved, the project manager creates a work plan, staffs the project, and decides on techniques.  

---

### Feasibility Study  
A feasibility study is a preliminary investigation that helps management decide whether to proceed with system development.  

#### Steps in Feasibility Analysis:  
1. Form a project team and appoint a project leader.  
2. Develop system flowcharts.  
3. Identify deficiencies in the current system and set goals.  
4. Enumerate alternative solutions or potential candidate systems.  
5. Determine the feasibility of each alternative (technical, operational, etc.).  
6. Weigh the performance and cost-effectiveness of each candidate system.  
7. Rank alternatives and select the best candidate system.  
8. Prepare a system proposal for management approval.  

#### Types of Feasibility:  
- **Economic Feasibility**: Cost/benefit analysis of the candidate system.  
- **Technical Feasibility**: Determines if the solution can be supported by existing technology.  
- **Operational Feasibility**: Assesses user acceptance and impact on business methods.  
- **Schedule Feasibility**: Ensures the project can be completed within the given time constraints.  

---

### SDLC Analysis Phase  
- **Purpose**: Determine who will use the system, what it will do, and where and when it will be used.  
- **Sub-phases**:  
  1. **Requirements Determination**: Study the organization’s current procedures and information systems.  
  2. **Requirements Structuring**: Establish relationships between requirements and eliminate redundancy.  

---

### SDLC Design Phase  
- **Purpose**: Convert the recommended solution into system specifications.  
- **Key Activities**:  
  - Define how the system will operate in terms of hardware, software, and network infrastructure.  
  - Design the user interface, forms, reports, programs, databases, and files.  
  - **Logical Design**: Functional features described independently of the computer platform.  
  - **Physical Design**: Logical specifications transformed into technology-specific details.  

---

### SDLC Implementation Phase  
- **Purpose**: Code, validate, install, and support the information system.  

---

### SDLC Maintenance Phase  
- **Purpose**: Systematically repair and improve the information system.  
- **Note**: Maintenance is not a separate phase but a repetition of the other life cycle phases.

## Basic Concepts of Business Analysis  

### What is Business Analysis?  
- Business analysis is the practice of enabling change in an enterprise by defining needs and recommending solutions that deliver value to stakeholders.  
- It involves articulating needs, designing solutions, and describing how they can deliver value.  

---

### Who is a Business Analyst?  
- A business analyst is responsible for discovering, synthesizing, and analyzing information from various sources within an enterprise.  
- Key responsibilities:  
  - Elicit stakeholder needs.  
  - Investigate and clarify expressed desires to determine underlying issues.  
  - Align solutions with stakeholder needs.  

---

### System Analyst  
- A system analyst works closely with project team members to ensure the right system is developed effectively.  
- Key responsibilities:  
	- Identify organizational improvements.  
	- Design systems to implement changes.  
	- Train and motivate others to use the systems.  

#### System Analyst Skills:  
1. Technical  
2. Business  
3. Analytical  
4. Interpersonal  
5. Management  
6. Ethical

### Business Analyst vs. System Analyst  
| **Business Analyst**                                                                 | **System Analyst**                                                                 |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Focuses on business processes.                                                       | Focuses on technical aspects.                                                     |
| May work on projects that do not involve software changes (e.g., process improvement). | Only involved when there is a software change.                                    |
| Focuses on data modeling, data design, and system integration.                       | Focuses on how data moves between systems and how systems are connected.          |

## The Business Analysis Core Concept Model  
The model consists of six core concepts:  

1. **Need**: A problem or opportunity to be addressed.  
2. **Change**: The act of transformation in response to a need.  
3. **Solution**: A specific way of satisfying one or more needs.  
4. **Stakeholder**: Individuals or groups with a relationship to the change, need, or solution.  
5. **Value**: The worth, importance, or usefulness of something to a stakeholder.  
6. **Context**: The circumstances that influence or are influenced by the change.

## Computer-Aided Software Engineering (CASE) Tools  
CASE tools support various SDLC activities, including project identification, planning, analysis, design, implementation, and maintenance.  

### Types of CASE Tools:  
- **Diagramming Tools**: Represent system processes, data, and control structures graphically.  
- **Display and Report Generators**: Prototype system interfaces.  
- **Analysis Tools**: Check for incomplete or incorrect specifications.  
- **Central Repository**: Stores specifications, diagrams, and project management information.  
- **Documentation Generators**: Produce technical and user documentation.  
- **Code Generators**: Automatically generate program and database code from design documents.  

---

## Sources of Application Software  
- **Cloud Computing**: Google Apps, Salesforce.com (CRM).  
- **IT Services Firms**: Microsoft, Oracle.  
- **Open Source Providers**: Linux OS, MySQL, Firefox.  
- **Packaged Software**: Accounting, HR, manufacturing, supply chain.  
- **In-House Development**: Custom software developed internally.  

---

## Outsourcing  
Outsourcing involves turning over responsibility for some or all of an organization’s information systems applications and operations to an outside firm.  

### Reasons to Outsource:  
- Cost-effective.  
- Frees up internal resources.  
- Reduces time to market.  
- Increases process efficiencies.  
- System development is a non-core activity for the organization.
