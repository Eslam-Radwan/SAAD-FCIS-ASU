### **Project Planning**  

- **Definition**:  
  - Involves breaking down the work into parts and assigning these to project team members.  
  - Anticipates potential problems and prepares tentative solutions.  
  - The project plan is created at the start of the project and is used to communicate how the work will be done to the team and customers.  
  - Helps assess progress on the project.  

**Chapter 23 Project Planning**  

---

### **Planning Stages**  

1. **Proposal Stage**:  
   - When bidding for a contract to develop or provide a software system.  

2. **Project Startup Phase**:  
   - Planning who will work on the project, how the project will be broken into increments, and how resources will be allocated.  

3. **Periodically Throughout the Project**:  
   - Modify the plan based on experience and progress monitoring.  

**Chapter 23 Project Planning**  

---

### **Proposal Planning**  

- **Software Engineering**:  
  - Planning may be necessary with only outline software requirements.  
  - Aim: Provide information for setting a price for the system.  
  - **Project Pricing**:  
    - Estimate development costs (staff, hardware, software, etc.).  

**Chapter 23 Project Planning**  

---

### **Project Startup Planning**  

- **At this stage**:  
  - More is known about system requirements and implementation.  
  - Create a detailed plan for budget and staffing decisions.  
  - Define project monitoring mechanisms.  
  - **Agile Development**:  
    - A startup plan is still needed to allocate resources.  

**Chapter 23 Project Planning**  

---

### **Development Planning**  

- **Software Engineering**:  
  - The project plan should be regularly amended as the project progresses.  
  - Regularly revise the project schedule, cost estimates, and risks.  

**Chapter 23 Project Planning**  

---

### **Software Pricing**  

- **Estimates**:  
  - Discover the cost of producing a software system (hardware, software, travel, training, effort costs).  
  - No simple relationship between development cost and price charged to the customer.  
  - Broader organizational, economic, political, and business considerations influence pricing.  

**Chapter 23 Project Planning**  

---

### **Factors Affecting Software Pricing**  

| **Factor**               | **Description**                                                                 |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Contractual Terms**     | Customer may allow developer to retain source code, reducing price.             |
| **Cost Estimate Uncertainty** | If unsure of cost estimate, increase price by a contingency.                   |
| **Financial Health**      | Developers in financial difficulty may lower prices to gain contracts.          |
| **Market Opportunity**    | Lower prices to enter new market segments, with potential for future profits.   |
| **Requirements Volatility** | Lower prices to win contracts, then charge high prices for requirement changes. |

**Chapter 23 Project Planning**  

---

### **Pricing Strategies**  

- **Under Pricing**:  
  - Gain contracts to retain staff or access new markets.  
- **Increased Pricing**:  
  - Increase prices for fixed-price contracts to account for unexpected risks.  

---

### **Plan-driven Development**  

- **Definition**:  
  - An approach where the development process is planned in detail.  
  - Traditional way of managing large software projects.  
  - A project plan records the work to be done, who will do it, the schedule, and work products.  
  - Managers use the plan for decision-making and progress measurement.  

**Chapter 23 Project Planning**

### **Plan-driven Development - Pros and Cons**  

| **Pros**                                                                 | **Cons**                                                                 |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Early planning allows organizational issues to be considered.            | Early decisions may need revision due to environmental changes.          |
| Potential problems and dependencies are discovered before the project starts. |                                                                          |

  - Plan changes are inevitable due to new information, changing requirements, and business goals.  

---

### **Planning Assumptions**  

- Make realistic assumptions, not optimistic ones.  
- Include contingency in the plan to account for unexpected problems.  

**Chapter 23 Project Planning**  

---

### **Risk Mitigation**  

- If serious problems arise, initiate risk mitigation actions.  
- Re-plan the project, renegotiate constraints, and establish a new schedule with the customer.  

**Chapter 23 Project Planning**  

---

### **Project Scheduling**  

- **Definition**:  
  - Deciding how work will be organized into tasks and when/how they will be executed.  
  - Estimate time, effort, and resources for each task.  

**Chapter 23 Project Planning**  

---

### **Project Scheduling Activities**  

- Split project into tasks and estimate time/resources.  
- Organize tasks concurrently to optimize workforce.  
- Minimize task dependencies to avoid delays.  
- Dependent on project manager's intuition and experience.  

**Chapter 23 Project Planning**  

---

### **Scheduling Problems**  

- Estimating problem difficulty and cost is hard.  
- Productivity is not proportional to the number of people working on a task.  
- Adding people to a late project makes it later due to communication overhead.  
- Always allow contingency for unexpected issues.  

**Chapter 23 Project Planning**  

---

### **Schedule Presentation**

- **Effort**: Number of workdays/hours required.  
- Effort does not equal duration.  
- Estimates should be created by the people doing the work and reviewed by experts.  

---

### **Three-Point Estimates**  

- **Optimistic, Most Likely, Pessimistic Estimates**:  
  - Example: Optimistic = 3 weeks, Most Likely = 4 weeks, Pessimistic = 5 weeks.  
  - Used for PERT estimates and Monte Carlo simulations.  

---

### **Schedule Development**

---

### **PERT Weighted Average Formula**  

**PERT weighted average = (Optimistic + 4 × Most Likely + Pessimistic) / 6**  

- **Example**:  
  - Optimistic = 8 days, Most Likely = 10 days, Pessimistic = 24 days.  
  - PERT weighted average = (8 + 4 × 10 + 24) / 6 = 12 days.  

---

### **Schedule Control**  

- Perform reality checks on schedules.  
- Allow for contingencies.  
- Don’t plan for 100% capacity all the time.  
- Hold progress meetings and communicate schedule issues honestly.
