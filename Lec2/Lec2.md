### **Project Planning**

Project planning involves:

- Breaking down the work into parts and assigning them to team members.
- Anticipating potential problems and preparing tentative solutions.
- Creating a project plan at the start to:
    - Communicate work structure to the team and customers.
    - Assess progress effectively.

---

### **Planning Stages**

1. **Proposal Stage**:
    
    - During contract bidding for software development.
2. **Project Startup Phase**:
    
    - Planning team assignments, project breakdown, and resource allocation.
3. **Periodic Updates**:
    
    - Modifying the plan as the project progresses and new information is obtained.

---

### **Proposal Planning**

- Focuses on providing estimates for project pricing based on:
    - Staff costs.
    - Hardware and software expenses.

---

### **Startup Planning**

- Detailed planning based on better-defined requirements.
- Includes:
    - Budget decisions.
    - Staffing.
    - Monitoring mechanisms.
- Even in agile methods, startup plans are crucial for resource allocation.

---

### **Development Planning**

- Regular updates to:
    - Project schedule.
    - Cost estimates.
    - Risk analysis.

---

### **Software Pricing**

Pricing considerations include:

- Hardware, software, travel, and training costs.
- Broader organizational and market factors influencing final prices.

#### **Factors Affecting Pricing**

|**Factor**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|Contractual terms|Ownership of source code may lower price.|
|Cost estimate uncertainty|Contingencies for uncertain estimates.|
|Financial health|Financially struggling developers may offer lower prices.|
|Market opportunity|Low pricing to enter a new market.|
|Requirements volatility|Discounts for flexible requirements.|

---

### **Pricing Strategies**

1. **Underpricing**:
    - To retain staff or enter new markets.
2. **Increased Pricing**:
    - To manage fixed-price contracts with potential risks.

---

### **Plan-Driven Development**

A traditional approach where detailed plans are created at the start.

- **Advantages**:
    - Early problem identification.
    - Clear organizational direction.
- **Disadvantages**:
    - Revisions may be needed due to environmental changes.

---

### **Project Plan Components**

A project plan outlines:

- Introduction.
- Project organization.
- Risk analysis.
- Resource requirements.
- Work breakdown and schedules.
- Monitoring and reporting mechanisms.

#### **Supplements**

|**Plan**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|Configuration management|Defines configuration handling procedures.|
|Deployment plan|Details software/hardware deployment.|
|Maintenance plan|Predicts long-term requirements and costs.|
|Quality plan|Standards and quality assurance processes.|
|Validation plan|Resources and approach for system validation.|

---

### **Planning Process and Assumptions**

- Planning is iterative; changes are inevitable.
- Plans should account for:
    - Contingencies to handle unexpected issues.
    - Risk mitigation to avoid delays.

---

### **Project Scheduling**

Scheduling involves:

1. Splitting work into tasks with time and resource estimates.
2. Minimizing task dependencies.
3. Organizing tasks concurrently for efficiency.

#### **Challenges**:

- Accurate difficulty estimation.
- Misaligned productivity assumptions.
- Communication overheads when scaling teams.

---

### **Schedule Presentation**

- **Bar Charts**: Show timelines for activities or resources.
- **Activity Networks**: Highlight task dependencies.

---

### **Milestones and Deliverables**

- **Milestones**: Key progress indicators (e.g., system handover).
- **Deliverables**: Outputs delivered to customers (e.g., reports).

---

### **Activity Network and Critical Path**

- **Activity Network Diagram**: Maps relationships and identifies critical paths.
- **Critical Path Method (CPM)**:
    - Longest sequence of dependent tasks.
    - **Slack/Float**: Time flexibility without delays.

---

### **PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique)**

A probabilistic approach for estimating uncertain durations:  
$$
\text{PERT Weighted Average} = \frac{\text{Optimistic} + 4 \times \text{Most Likely} + \text{Pessimistic}}{6}
$$

Example:  
$$
\text{PERT Average} = \frac{8 + 4(10) + 24}{6} = 12 \text{ days}

$$
---

### **Schedule Control**

- Include contingencies.
- Avoid 100% capacity planning.
- Communicate schedule changes transparently.

---

### **Agile Planning**

Agile focuses on delivering functionality incrementally based on customer priorities.

- **Challenges**:
    - Dependence on customer involvement.
    - May conflict with traditional planning preferences.

---

### **Discussion Questions**

1. Discuss why project planning is not confined to the proposal and startup phases.
2. Justify the importance of plan-driven development.
3. Explain the significance of supplementary project plans.
4. Elaborate on the need for contingency planning.
5. Why are plan changes inevitable?
6. What actions are required when delays are unavoidable?
