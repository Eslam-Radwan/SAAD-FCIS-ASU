# System Analysis and Design Lectures Extraction

- I have used [deepseek](https://www.deepseek.com/) to convert lectures to markdown representation.

## Here is the used prompt:

```
Extract all text without removing any content. Replace all figures or images with the word '[FIGURE]', and ensure the formatting remains consistent and easily readable. and format while keeping all figures and add bullet points and comparison tables if needed and reformat while keeping everything

```
