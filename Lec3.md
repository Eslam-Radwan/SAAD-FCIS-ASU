## Business Need

The business need includes the following aspects:

- Sales Process
- Business Analysis
- QA/Testers
- Solutions Proposal
- Documentation
- Implementation
- Project Manager
- Customer Acceptance

---

## Analysis Phase

The analysis phase answers the following key questions:

- **Who** will use the system?
- **What** the system will do?
- **Where** and **when** the system will be used?

### Sub-Phases of Analysis

1. **Requirements Determination:**  
    Study the organization's current procedures and the information systems used.
    
2. **Requirements Structuring:**  
    Organize and eliminate redundant requirements.

## What is a Requirement?

A **requirement** is a usable representation of a need. It defines:

- A **Feature** (e.g., Cloud Access)
- A **Function** (e.g., Calculate Savings)
- A **Fact** (e.g., regulations)
- A **Quality** (e.g., access file in 1 second)

---

## Requirement Classification

1. **Business Requirements**
2. **Stakeholder Requirements**
3. **Solution Requirements**
4. **Transition Requirements**

### Detailed Breakdown

1. **Business Requirements:**  
    Goals, objectives, and outcomes that define the need for change across the enterprise, business area, or initiative.
    
2. **Stakeholder Requirements:**  
    Needs and wants of stakeholders that must be met to achieve business requirements. These serve as a bridge between business and solution requirements.
    
3. **Solution Requirements:**  
    Capabilities and qualities of the solution that meet stakeholder requirements. This includes:
    
    - **Functional Requirements:** What the system should **DO**.
    - **Non-Functional Requirements:** How the system should **BE**.
4. **Transition Requirements:**  
    Describes capabilities required for transitioning from the current state to the future state, including topics like data conversion and training.

## Business Requirements

- Defines the high-level goals and objectives.
- Answers the question: **Why** is the project needed?
- Usually defined at the executive level.

### Recommended Structure for Business Requirements:

- **Business Outcome**
- **Organization/Group**
- **Action (Need/Want/Will/Should)**

---

### Business Requirements Examples

- **Example 1:**  
    To maintain our leadership role in the industry, BA-EXPERTS needs to increase online sales by 15% this fiscal year.
    
- **Example 2:**  
    To improve customer retention, the claims department must reduce claims processing time from 10 days to 1 day by the end of Q3.
    

---

## Stakeholder Requirements

- Describes the needs and wants of stakeholders and how they will interact with the solution.
- Serves as a bridge between business and solution requirements.

### Structure for Stakeholder Requirements:

"As a **[Stakeholder/Group]**, I **can/cannot** **[Action]** to **[Goal/Objective].**"

---

### Stakeholder Requirements Examples

- **Example 1:**  
    As a customer, I can browse the product catalog to select items I want to buy.
    
- **Example 2:**  
    As a website visitor, I can view the cost of coverage for each insurance provider.

## Solution Requirements

Describes the characteristics of the solution that meet business and stakeholder requirements. These include:

### Functional Requirements

- List of functions and use cases.
- Data elements, prototypes, process, and activity diagrams.

**Examples of Functional Requirements:**

- Calculate total charges including delivery costs and taxes.
- Prevent shipping goods to customers with overdue accounts.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**
- **Scalability**
- **Portability**
- **Usability**
- **Compatibility**
- **Reliability**
- **Security**
- **Maintainability**
- **Availability**

---

## Transition Requirements

Describes capabilities needed to transition from the current to the future state. These include:

- Data conversion
- Training
- Business continuity

---

### Transition Requirements Examples

- Sales personnel must attend a 2-day new customer acquisition program before using the new system.
- Customer data will be maintained in both old and new formats until the end of the first quarter.

---

## Examples

- **Stakeholder Requirement:**  
    As a user, the app must run on all versions of the iPhone.
    
- **Solution Requirement:**
    
    - **Functional Requirement:** The app must have a drop-down menu for product selection.
    - **Non-Functional Requirement:** The app must be 100% reliable under high traffic.

## Requirement Determination Tasks

1. **Prepare for Elicitation**
2. **Conduct Elicitation**
3. **Confirm Elicitation Results**
4. **Communicate Information**
5. **Manage Stakeholder Collaboration**

### 1. Prepare for Elicitation

- Define desired outcomes.
- Consider stakeholders and their goals.
- Select appropriate elicitation techniques.
- Ensure logistical readiness and supporting materials.

### 2. Conduct Elicitation

- Draw out and explore relevant information for the change.

**Elicitation Techniques:**

- **Traditional:**
    - Interviewing (individual and groups)
    - Surveys and Questionnaires
    - Ethnography
    - Document Analysis
- **Modern:**
    - Joint Application Design (JAD)
    - Prototyping

### 3. Confirm Elicitation Results

- Review the elicited information for errors and omissions.
- Resolve any discrepancies with stakeholders before proceeding.

### 4. Communicate Information

- Share analysis information with stakeholders in an appropriate format.
- Ensure stakeholders have a shared understanding of the information.

### 5. Manage Stakeholder Collaboration

- Encourage stakeholders to work towards a common goal.
- Ensure the right stakeholders are involved at the right time.

## Stakeholder Matrix

|**Influence of Stakeholder**|**Impact on Stakeholder**|
|---|---|
|High: Ensure satisfaction.|Work closely to ensure support for the change.|
|Monitor interest and influence.|Keep informed; stakeholder may feel anxious about lack of control.|

## Personas

A **persona** is a fictional character that exemplifies how a typical user interacts with a product.

**Examples:**

- Yoshi: 20-year-old pole vaulter from Tokyo, speaks some English.
- Bob: IBM sysadmin in New York.
- Fritz: 50-year-old father from Germany.

## Hospital Management System Example

1. **Doctor Requirements:**  
    Can visit patients, prescribe drugs, schedule procedures, etc.
    
2. **System Requirements:**  
    Must store symptom, diagnosis, and prescription information.
    
3. **Patient Requirements:**  
    Can register, confirm procedures, and request discharge.
    
4. **Patient History:**  
    Accessible by doctors for informed decisions.
    
5. **Patient Status:**  
    Includes hospitalized, intensive care, discharged.
    

---

## Exercise

1. Re-write requirement 3 as a stakeholder requirement.
2. Re-write requirement 4 as a non-functional requirement.
3. Suggest a transition requirement for the hospital system.
4. Which is a business requirement?
5. Suggest two personas based on requirement 3.
